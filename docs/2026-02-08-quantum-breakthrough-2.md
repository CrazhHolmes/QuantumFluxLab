## The Breakthrough

Test quantum erasure with polarized lenses & laser pointer

## Why It Matters

This breakthrough leverages quantum mechanical phenomena that were previously only accessible in specialized laboratories. The suggested experiment makes quantum effects visible using inexpensive, readily available components.

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

### Shopping List

- [ ] Polarizing filters (2x) ($10)
- [ ] Laser pointer (red) ($15)
- [ ] Cardboard/3D printed mounts ($5)

### Step-by-Step

1. Set up laser pointer on stable surface
2. Place first polarizer in beam path
3. Add second polarizer and rotate 90° (beam should extinguish)
4. Insert third polarizer at 45° between them (beam reappears!)
5. Document results and compare with theoretical predictions
