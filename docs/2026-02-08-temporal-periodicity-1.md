**Query:** quantum
**Sources:** arxiv
**Confidence:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (Medium)

## The Breakthrough

555 timer + LED at 1 Hz, observe after-image

## Why It Matters

Time crystals represent a new phase of matter. This simple analog demonstrates the core concept of discrete time-translation symmetry breaking in an accessible way.
