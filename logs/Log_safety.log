[2026-01-31 17:46:30] HIGH VOLTAGE SAFETY ANALYSIS
Operating Voltage: 10-30 kV DC (from piezo sparker array)

Paschen's Law Calculations:
- Breakdown voltage in air: V_breakdown ≈ 3 kV/mm (standard conditions)

- Safety margin: 3:1 (operating at 1/3 of breakdown)

Electric Field Limits:
- Occupational exposure (IEEE C95.1): 5 kV/m (continuous), 20 kV/m (short term)
- Device field at 1m distance: ~0.3 kV/m (safe)
- Device field at 10cm: ~3 kV/m (warning zone)
