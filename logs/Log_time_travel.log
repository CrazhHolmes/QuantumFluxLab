[2026-01-31 17:46:00] WARP DRIVES & CLOSED TIMELIKE CURVES
Source: arXiv:2309.10072 (Barak Shoshany, 2023)
Title: "Warp Drives and Closed Timelike Curves"
Key Finding: Two warp drives can be glued together to create a closed timelike geodesic
Mathematical Model: Non-unit lapse function allows frame switching between warp bubbles
Significance: First explicit formulation using TWO warp drives for CTC construction
Status: Theoretical - requires exotic matter (negative energy density)

[2026-01-31 17:47:30] ROTATING ALCUBIERRE METRIC MODIFICATIONS
Source: arXiv:2407.18993 (Ralph & Chang, 2024)
Title: "Controlled closed timelike geodesics in a rotating Alcubierre metric"
Key Finding: Spatially-dependent rotation rate creates simple approximate timelike geodesics
that are also CTCs when warp bubble velocity varies slowly
Novel Aspect: Cylindrical spacetime with periodic boundary contains EXACT timelike geodesic CTCs
Physical Interpretation: Particle enters from flat space, travels back in time, exits to flat space
Causal Structure: Enters/exits in chronology-respecting regions

[2026-01-31 17:49:00] MACROSCOPIC DELAYED-CHOICE QUANTUM ERASER
Source: arXiv:2109.12465 (Reid et al., 2021)
Title: "Macroscopic delayed-choice and retrocausality"
Key Finding: Macroscopic qubits (|α⟩ and |-α⟩ coherent states) demonstrate delayed choice
Conclusion: "Viewpoint that system photon behaves definitely as wave or particle would require
          faster-than-light communication"
Significance: Macroscopic quantum effects observable with continuous wave laser

Source: arXiv:2205.14353 (Ham, 2022)
Title: "A macroscopic delayed-choice quantum eraser using continuous wave laser"
Experimental Setup: Noninterfering Mach-Zehnder with polarizing beam splitters
Result: Post-determination of photon nature achieved in macroscopic regime
Temporal Aspect: Choice made AFTER photon has "passed" through apparatus

[2026-01-31 17:51:00] GARAGE-SCALE EXPERIMENTAL POSSIBILITIES

EXPERIMENT 1: Optical Delay-Line Temporal Illusion
Hypothesis: Demonstrate relativity of simultaneity with fiber optics
Setup:
  - 1km single-mode fiber = ~5μs delay
  - Fast optical switch (Pockels cell or MEMS)
  - Single photon source or attenuated laser
  - Beam splitters for path interference
Cost Estimate: $50-100 (fiber from telecom surplus, switches from eBay)
Expected Result: "Choice" of measurement basis after photon has entered fiber
Connection to CTCs: Demonstrates frame-dependent temporal ordering

EXPERIMENT 2: Ring Resonator Analog
Hypothesis: Create closed optical path with circulating pulse
Setup:
  - Fiber loop with coupler (99:1)
  - Variable optical attenuator
  - Fast detector for pulse monitoring
Mathematical analogy: Light following CTC in optical fiber
Cost Estimate: $30-50
Limitation: No actual time travel - only demonstrates closed path physics

EXPERIMENT 3: Dispersive Medium "Temporal Reversal"
Hypothesis: Group velocity > c/n creates apparent backward propagation
Setup:
  - Anomalous dispersion medium (heated Cs vapor or photonic crystal)
  - Pump-probe configuration
  - Oscilloscope for time-of-flight measurement
Reference: "Superluminal group velocity" experiments (Wang et al., Nature 2000)
Cost Estimate: $40-80 (Cs cells surplus, heaters DIY)
Note: Does NOT violate causality - only group velocity, not information velocity

[2026-01-31 17:55:00] CHERENKOV-LIKE TEMPORAL SIGNALS

Theory: Charged particles exceeding phase velocity of light in medium emit Cherenkov radiation
Temporal Aspect: Coherent radiation forms cone - arrival time encodes velocity history
Garage-Scale Analog:
  - Electron beam from CRT (old TV tube)
  - Scintillator or water tank
  - PMT or SiPM for light detection
  - Oscilloscope for timing

Observation: Temporal structure of Cherenkov pulse reveals particle history
Cost: $0-20 (salvaged CRT, surplus PMT)

[2026-01-31 17:58:00] QUANTUM CORRELATION EXPERIMENTS

Polarization Entanglement (SPDC):
  - BBO crystal + UV LED or laser pointer
  - Polarizers and coincidence detection
  - Delayed choice: Polarizer angle set while photons "in flight"
  - Cost: $50-100 (optics from Thorlabs/educational kits)

Temporal Bell Inequality:
  - Test bounds on correlations with temporal separation
  - Requires: Fast electronics, time-tagging
  - Cost: $100-200 (SPAD modules, TDC)

[2026-01-31 18:00:00] SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONS

MOST FEASIBLE GARAGE EXPERIMENT:
Delayed-Choice Optical Delay Line ($50-75 budget)
Components:
  1. 1km fiber spool - $20 eBay
  2. 2x FC/PC beam splitters - $15
  3. MEMS optical switch - $25
  4. Laser diode - $5
  5. Photodiode - $5
  6. Arduino for control - $5

This demonstrates the PRINCIPLE of temporal nonlocality without exotic physics.
While NOT actual time travel, it probes the same conceptual space as CTC physics.
